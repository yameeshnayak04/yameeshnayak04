## 🪪 About Me

I’m an Information Technology undergraduate at **Shri G.S. Institute of Technology & Science (SGSITS), Indore**. I focus on designing and building production-ready software, backend systems, and scalable architectures that solve real-world problems.

I enjoy working on:
- **Backend systems & APIs** (designing robust, maintainable services)
- **Real-world software solutions** with reliability and observability in mind
- **Node.js + MongoDB backends** and service integrations
- **REST APIs**, authentication flows, and role-based access control
- Real-time systems and event-driven architectures
- AI-assisted decision systems & automation
- Mobile applications with **Flutter** (as a complementary focus)

I believe software should be **simple, reliable, and maintainable**—built with purpose and production-readiness.
